# NIKESHA Cream Website

This is a premium, multi-page website for NIKESHA cream, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## How to Run
Since we used the CDN version of Tailwind CSS (to avoid Node.js as requested), you can simply open the files in your browser.

1.  Navigate to the folder `c:\Users\HI\Desktop\WEB`
2.  Double-click on `index.html` to open the home page in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).
3.  Use the navigation menu to visit the Collection, Our Story, and Contact pages.

## Customization
-   **Images**: You can replace the Unsplash image URLs in the HTML files with your own product images. Look for the `src="..."` attributes in the architecture.
-   **Text**: Edit the text in the HTML files to update the descriptions, phone numbers, and pricing.

## Technologies Used
-   HTML5
-   Tailwind CSS (via CDN with custom config)
-   JavaScript (Vanilla)
